- Duetotheseclearadvantages,analyticalsolutionshavereceivedfairly good attentions in the past fifty years. There are diverse mod-els for flow distributions in manifolds which scatter in differentfields. Most of the theoretical models are traditionally based onBernoulli theorem or slight modification thereof. However, a prob-lem raised from the experiments by McNown[30]and Acrivos et al.[31]

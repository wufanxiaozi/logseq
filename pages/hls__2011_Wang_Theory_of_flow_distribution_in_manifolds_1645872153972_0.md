- Duetotheseclearadvantages,analyticalsolutionshavereceivedfairly good attentions in the past fifty years. There are diverse mod-els for flow distributions in manifolds which scatter in differentfields. Most of the theoretical models are traditionally based onBernoulli theorem or slight modification thereof. However, a prob-lem raised from the experiments by McNown[30]and Acrivos et al.[31]

- The advantage of applying the momentum conservation is that onedoes not need to know detailed flow patterns and the flow processcan be simplified. Any error due to simplification can be correctedwith pressure recovery factor, friction factor and discharge factor.

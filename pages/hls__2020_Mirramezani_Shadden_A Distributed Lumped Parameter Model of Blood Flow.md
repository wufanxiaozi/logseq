- Assuming Poiseuille flow, the pressure drop across acylindrical vessel of lengthLis given byDP¼RvQ,whereRv¼8lL=pR4is the hydraulic resistance, withlbeing the blood viscosity andRbeing the vesselradius. We first consider an integral form of thisequation to better account for variations of radiusalong the vessel length as

- [[Abstract]]
	- In this study, the effects of different parameters on ﬂow structure and ﬂow hydraulics for combining sewer junction consisting of manhole and lateral inﬂow were investigated numerically. For this purpose, the effects of dimension variations, main and lateral pipe slope, angle and the joint position of lateral pipe beside manhole, manhole geometry, and the outﬂow rate of manhole on ﬂow structure and energy loss coefﬁcients were investigated. Results show that the rate of energy loss decreases by heightening the installation position of lateral pipe beside manhole. In addition, it was shown that the slope variations of main and lateral pipes and outﬂow rate do not affect the rate of energy loss.

- Current methods for estimating losses rely on relatively complex empirical equations that are only valid for specific junction geometries and flow regimes. 目前估计损耗的方法依赖于相对复杂的经验方程，这些方程仅对特定的结几何形状和流态有效。

- In pulsatile multi-directional flows, switch-ing between empirical equations upon reversing flow may introduce unrealistic discontinuities in simulated haemodynamic waveforms.

- ontinuities in simu-lated waveforms were avoided by extending Bassettet al.’s control volume-based method to incorporate a‘pseudodatum’ supplier branch, an imaginary effective vessel containing all inflow to the junction. Energyexchange between diverging flow streams was also accounted for empirically. Th

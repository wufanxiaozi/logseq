- Current methods for estimating losses rely on relatively complex empirical equations that are only valid for specific junction geometries and flow regimes. 目前估计损耗的方法依赖于相对复杂的经验方程，这些方程仅对特定的结几何形状和流态有效。

- Discontinuities in simu-lated waveforms were avoided by extending Bassettet al.’s control volume-based method to incorporate a‘pseudodatum’ supplier branch, an imaginary effective vessel containing all inflow to the junction. Energyexchange between diverging flow streams was also accounted for empirically. Th

- Various empirical equationsexist for estimating junction loss coefficients in reduced-order models, but these can only be appliedto specific junction configurations and flow conditions. In addition, we have found that switchingbetween such equations when flow conditions change dynamically can lead to non-physiologicaldiscontinuities in the simulated pressure/flow waveforms.以往这些经验模型的缺点

	- In reduced-order (0D/1D) blood or respiratory ﬂow models, pressure losses at junctions are usually neglected. However, these may become important where velocities are high and signiﬁcant ﬂow redirection occurs. Current methods for estimating losses rely on relatively complex empirical equations that are only valid for speciﬁc junction geometries and ﬂow regimes. In pulsatile multi-directional ﬂows, switching between empirical equations upon reversing ﬂow may introduce unrealistic discontinuities in simulated haemodynamic waveforms. Drawing from work by Bassett et al. (SAE Trans 112:565-583, 2003), we therefore developed a uniﬁed method (Uniﬁed0D) for estimating loss coefﬁcients that can be applied to any junction (i.e. any number of branches at any angle) and any ﬂow regime. Discontinuities in simulated waveforms were avoided by extending Bassett et al.’s control volume-based method to incorporate a ‘pseudodatum’ supplier branch, an imaginary effective vessel containing all inﬂow to the junction. Energy exchange between diverging ﬂow streams was also accounted for empirically. The formulation was validated using high resolution computational ﬂuid dynamics in a wide range ﬂow conditions and junction conﬁgurations. In a pulsatile 1D simulation exhibiting transitions between four different ﬂow regimes, the new formulation produced smooth transitions in calculated pressure losses.

- [[Abstract]]
	- This paper describes optimality principles for the design of an engineering bifurcating-tube tree consisting of the convection and diffusion zones to attain the most effective gas transport. An optimality principle is formulated for the diffusion zone to maximize the total diffusion mass-transfer rate of gas across tube walls under a constant total-volume constraint. This optimality principle produces a new diameter distribution for the diffusion zone in contrast to the classical distribution for the convection zone. In addition. this paper gives a length distribution for an engineering tree based on an optimality principle for minimizing the total weight of the tree under constraints of a finite surface and elastic criteria for structural stability. Furthermore, the optimum branching angles are evaluated based on local optimality principles for a single bifurcating-tube branch.

- Also, a large number of experimentalstudies presented various energy loss coefficients for flowspassing the junctions of closed pipes in a pressurised flowregime (McNown 1954; Gardel 1957a,b; Sangsteret al. 1958,1961; Blaisdell & Manson 1963; Ito & Imai 1973; Lindvall1984, 1987; Johnston & Volker 1990; Miller 1990; Serreet al.1994; Ramamurthy & Zhu 1997). These tests were conductedfor different branches and main diameter ratios, and for dif-ferent pipe alignments.

- review is presented of the physical principles governing the distribution of blood flow and bloodpressure in the vascular system. The main factors involved are the pulsatile driving pressure gen-erated by the heart, the flow characteristics of blood, and the geometric structure and mechanicalproperties of the vessels. The relationship between driving pressure and flow in a given vessel canbe understood by considering the viscou

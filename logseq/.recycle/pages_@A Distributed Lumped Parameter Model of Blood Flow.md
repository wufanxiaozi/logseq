- [[Abstract]]
	- We propose a distributed lumped parameter (DLP) modeling framework to efﬁciently compute blood ﬂow and pressure in vascular domains. This is achieved by developing analytical expressions describing expected energy losses along vascular segments, including from viscous dissipation, unsteadiness, ﬂow separation, vessel curvature and vessel bifurcations. We apply this methodology to solve for unsteady blood ﬂow and pressure in a variety of complex 3D image-based vascular geometries, which are typically approached using computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The proposed DLP framework demonstrated consistent agreement with CFD simulations in terms of ﬂow rate and pressure distribution, with mean errors less than 7% over a broad range of hemodynamic conditions and vascular geometries. The computational cost of the DLP framework is orders of magnitude lower than the computational cost of CFD, which opens new possibilities for hemodynamics modeling in timely decision support scenarios, and a multitude of applications of imaged-based modeling that require ensembles of numerical simulations.
